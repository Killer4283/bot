# Using the Official Mantaro Bot

**Just one [click](https://add.mantaro.site) and you can add Mantaro to your own server and enjoy its full feature set!**

You can see more information about the bot itself by reading the summary on [here](https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/blob/master/FEATURES.md). This is the file we use to publish our bots on bot lists, too. You're welcome to use it as a guide for your own.

Our [webpage](https://mantaro.site) is hosted in [Github Pages](https://github.com/Mantaro/mantaro.github.io). If you want to help us make a webpage, you can poke us.

# Building your own Mantaro

## âš  **Read before attempting**
The owners of Mantaro do not recommend compiling Mantaro as it is not documented and most builds here will be extremely unstable and (probably) untested, probably including unfinished features. There's no *stable* branch, all of the features are immediately added to upstream.\
You will however sometimes see a legacy branch, a branch we create before publishing larger update containing working code, it is highly recommended to base your building process from the legacy branch, as the master branch will very likely contain broken and non-working code, at least in a case where a legay branch exist.

**We will not provide any support whatsoever in selfhosting or building the bot by yourself.**
The reason for this is because not only can the builds in here be highly unstable, but also there are very few people who could actually help with questions regarding this, most of which are busy and not available to answer said questions.

## Building the Bot

### Prerequisite:

You will need the following to utilize all of Mantaro's features (items marked with a star are optional):
* RethinkDB
* JDK
* Redis
* Wolke's Weeb API (For most of the action commands)*
* Other unmentioned API keys*

**We will not provide any support whatsoever in obtaining any of the above.**

<sub>Note: The bot does not necessarily need these keys to function, but some functionality might be limited by the lack of them (ex. without Wolke's API keys, you can't use the action commands, and they won't register). Due to the closed nature of that API, we encourage you to submit a patch that would allow custom images to be used on self-hosted instances if you'd like (ex. by pushing your own -local- API server), but keep them in line with the rest of the code.</sub> 

### Editing Code:
Mantaro isn't a modular bot (sadly), but removing features is fairly easy. You can just remove the respective command or the Module file on the commands directory and everything -should- still work. The exception are some Modules that are required by other Modules.
Make sure you pay close attention to the [License](https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/blob/master/LICENSE) as you will be required to disclose your source as well as state any changes made.

### Steps for building:
<sub>Please do note that you will not receive any help whatsoever while trying to build your own Mantaro.</sub>
1.  Make sure you have the prerequisites installed and running.
2.  Make sure your Java version is 11 or later.
2.  Clone this repository (you can also fork this repo and clone your fork). 
3.  Open a Terminal in the root folder.
4.  Run `gradlew shadowJar`
5.  Grab the jar from `build/libs`
6.  Install `rethinkdb` and `redis`
7.  Create the `mantaro` database with the following tables: mantaro, players, marriages, playerstats, users, guilds, keys, commands, seasonalplayers
8.  Run it and prepare yourself to start filling in some config values (open the jar on the command line using java -jar name.jar and wait for it to crash, then it'll generate the config.json file for you to fill).
9.  In config.json, set the value needApi to false. (Or clone and run https://github.com/Kodehawa/mantaro-api)
