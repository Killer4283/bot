 - Browse the Local Folder of it and go to `\src\main\resources\assets\languages`.

 - When creating a new translation, copy the en_US.json and rename the copy to your language (i.e German (Germany) would be de_DE.json) otherwise edit the file you want to contribute to.
    - When editing please use an actual code Editor to edit and not notepad. We suggest [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

 - Replace all english sentences with the coresponding translation.
   - DO NOT replace anything that looks like %\<x> or $%\<x> they are used for formatting, you may move them arround to accomodate for grammar in your Language (i.e The number of won credits in slots, etc.).
   - If you need a percentage sign place it as %%, not %.
   - Optionaly you can add yourself to the bottom of this table while translating.

 - Once done, save the file and go back to your Github desktop client.

 - You'll see changes made. UNTICK everything thats not your langauge file (or the README incase you edited the table below).

 - Give the commit a name and hit commit to.

 - Go to the top and click push to origin.

 - Go back to your Fork on github and click pull request.
