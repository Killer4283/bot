 - Browse the Local Folder of it and go to `\src\main\resources\assets\languages`.

 - When creating a new translation, copy the en_US.json and rename the copy to your language (i.e German (Germany) would be de_DE.json) otherwise edit the file you want to contribute to.
    - When editing please use an actual code Editor to edit and not notepad. We suggest [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

 - Replace all english sentences with the coresponding translation. Follow the guide below while translating.
   + Keep the overall feeling of the bot consistent with the english version.
   + Don't "paste old translations" into your translation file. All new translations will be added *at the top of the category*, which means you can just paste from en_US the missing ones until the one you have. (and at the bottom of the command in the case of new command strings)
   + Keep the translation clean.
   + Don't remove or "translate" anything remotely like %1$s, %2$s or %\<number\>$s. [More info](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/util/Formattable.html)
   + Don't change the formatting marks (\*\*, \*, etc). If a word is \*\*like this\*\* translate it \*\*como esto\*\*, for example.
   + We're gonna review translation files before going to production, so no worries if something happens to go wrong we will point it out and assist you.
   + If you're unsure what a parameter is, you can try using the command or contact MrLar ðŸŒº#0611 or Kodehawa#3457.
   + For languages that are read backwards (compared to english), the %\<number\>$s-alike parameters can be moved to accomodate your language reading. You can contact MrLar ðŸŒº#0611 or Kodehawa#3457 on Discord if you're lost.
   
 - After you are done, send the changed file to Kodehawa#3457 or MrLar ðŸŒº#0611 on Discord for review (Please include a message on why you are sending it, aswell as the langauge you translated to).
 
 - Once reviewed and being given the ok, go back to your Github desktop client.

 - You'll see changes made. UNTICK everything thats not your langauge file (or the README incase you edited the table below).

 - Give the commit a name and hit commit to.

 - Go to the top and click push to origin.

 - Go back to your Fork on github and click pull request.
